`tui-fuzzy-finder` is a [fzf] style text UI fuzzy finder library in Swift. It lists the contents
of an asynchronous stream in the terminal, one item per line. The user can select one or multiple
items from the list and use fuzzy search to filter the list, and when they press return,
`tui-fuzzy-finder` returns the list of the selected items.

## Why

`fzf` is a fantastic tool, but if you're not into shell scripting, it can be be a drag. This library
aims to provide the core functionality of `fzf` in a Swift library, so you can write your tools
in Swift.

Because `tui-fuzzy-finder` is in Swift and runs inside your code, you can use use any normal Swift values
for the list, as long as they conform to `CustomStringConvertible`. You can even make them display
ANSI escape sequences.

## What is included

`tui-fuzzy-finder` consists of a Swift library and an executable, `sfzf`, that uses it. The purpose
of `sfzf` is to make it easy to excercise the `tui-fuzzy-finder` features that are difficult to test
automatically. It does not try to compete with `fzf`.

## Documentation

[Documentation](https://swiftpackageindex.com/juri/swift-tui-fuzzy-finder/documentation)
is available at the Swift Package Index.

## Command line usage

To build and install the executable run `swift build -c release`, then copy `.build/release/sfzf`
somewhere on your path.

Run `sfzf --help` to get information about command line arguments.

While the program is running:

- Move up and down with arrows
- Edit the filter line with normal line-editing commands
- Toggle selection with tab
- Press return to exit and write the selected lines to stdout

## Goals

- Sufficient coverage of `fzf` features.
- Fast enough.

### Stretch goals

- Good platform coverage. PRs are welcome where it falls short.

## Non-goals

- Replacing `fzf` as a shell tool.
- Supporting the `fzf` features that only make sense in the shell scripting context.
